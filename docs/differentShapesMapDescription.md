{
  private static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    var mapDescription = new MapDescription<int>();

    // Add rooms here
    // Add passages here
    // Add default room shapes here

    var bossRoom = new RoomDescription(
      new GridPolygonBuilder()
        .AddPoint(0, 0)
        .AddPoint(0, 6)
        .AddPoint(6, 6)
        .AddPoint(6, 0)
        .Build(),
      new OverlapMode(1, 1)
    );
